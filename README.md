# Features
## Customised background image, Responsive design, Hidden How to play instructions heading, Restart button, Clapping sound effect

I chose to use the image background credit from (https://gibbswrightlawyers.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Question.jpg)
I have used responsive design in such a way that users can play the game on larger or smaller screens.
There is a instructions of how to play the game, user needs to click on "How to play" and it will pop down.
End of the game i also made a restart button, so users can restart the game and play again if they want to, it saves them refreshing the page to play again.
Once user guesses the correct number, they will get "Congratulations! You guessed the right number (number chosen from computer) in (number of attempts) attempts." message as well as clapping sound effect in the background.
